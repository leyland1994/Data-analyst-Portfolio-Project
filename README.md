This project is a beginner-friendly data analysis case study using an e-commerce dataset. The objective was to analyze customer transactions to extract actionable insights for business improvement. 
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a real-world e-commerce dataset using Python. I worked with online retail transaction data to uncover trends in customer behavior, product sales, and overall business performance. After loading the data into a Jupyter Notebook, I used libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy to clean and analyze the datasetâ€”examining the structure, identifying missing values, and exploring key metrics like total sales, product popularity, and customer activity. Through this analysis, I gained hands-on experience in handling messy data, performing EDA, and communicating findings with visualizations, making this a valuable addition to my data analyst portfolio.
